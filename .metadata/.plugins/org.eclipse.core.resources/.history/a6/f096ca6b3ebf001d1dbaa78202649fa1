 * According to the leap year rule, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 
 * but not divisible by 100, or if it is divisible by 400. If year satisfies this condition, 
 * the code inside the if statement will execute and the program 
 * will print "year is a leap year." If year does not satisfy this condition, the code inside the else statement will execute and the program will print "year is not a leap year."*/
